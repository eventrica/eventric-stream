# Eventric Core

This repository contains the core libraries for the Eventric Framework, providing
the basic primitives for event persistence and query, common projection types,
event distribution and replay, etc.

Additionally, this repository contains libraries intended for quality of life
improvements such as macros, etc. to bridge the gap between the relatively low-level
model of the underlying event system and more strongly-typed and idiomatic code at
the application/library level.
